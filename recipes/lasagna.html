    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. <br />
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. <br />
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 pound  lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can chrushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>etc</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. <br />Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. <br />Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br />Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. <br />Drain and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
